PREREQUISITES

You'll need to have these libraries (with equivalent devel versions) to
build M.A.X.R.:

 libsdl1.2
 libsdl-mixer1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-net

SDL libraries can be found at http://www.libsdl.org

The .tar.gz file is distributed with a working set of configure and 
makefiles. They are not in the SVN repository. Consequently, if you 
are building from SVN, you will have to set up these files on your
own (or simply configure a new c++/sdl project in the IDE of your
choice). There's an alternate makefile in mk/

Sourcecode:

You can get it here:

Or fresh from the SVN here:

svn://maxr.org/MAX/trunk

LINUX

	First untar the package:
	
	$ tar xfzv maxr-x.y.z.tar.gz
	
	Then change to the new directory:
	
	$ cd maxr-x.y.z
	
	Set up the Makefiles and create the configure scripts:
	
	$ ./configure
	
	If everything went well you should now be able to run make. 

	$ make install
	
	Compiles the maxr binary and installs it along with the game
	data to the default prefix which is probably /usr/local.

	Use make DESTDIR=/foo/bar install to make use of destdir.

	Hint: To override the data path set MAXRDATA e.g.:

	$ MAXRDATA=~/maxr-x.y.z/data ~/maxr-x.y.z/src/maxr

Rebuilding:

You should clean your existing maxr release build first with:

 $ make distclean

If you want to clean your maxr SVN build do:

 $ make maintainer-clean

Starting:

After installing you can start maxr executing ./maxr

If you don't want to install maxr simply point MAXRDATA to your data
folder and execute the binary maxr.

Example: 

 $ MAXRDATA=/foo/bar/data ./maxr
