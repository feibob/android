/**	A singleton class for calculating costs for upgrades and research and for
	getting the	results of such upgrades and research.
	In M.A.X. research and gold upgrades have no direct influence on each other.
	Their effects are simply added.
	Example:
	The first step for the armor 10 upgrade is 5 gold to get from armor 10 to 11.
	If you research armor till you have 50% you will have armor 15. But the first
	gold upgrade step will still cost 5 gold. And it will go up from 15 to 16.
	Other example:
	If you have gold-upgraded the speed of an awac from 18 to 32 and do now
	a speed research, then you will still get only an additional bonus of 1
	for the first research (and not 3). This is because the research benefit
	is	always calculated on the basis of the start value and not of the current
	value.

	To use this class, simply call: cUpdateCalculator::instance().theMethodINeed()
